# Computational Neuroscience

This repo contains a selection of projects from PSYC B265: Computational Neuroscience taken with Yeon Soon Shin in Fall 2025. All projects completed in Python language in Jupyter Notebook environment.

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-Layer-Perceptron.ipynb | Using tensorflow, keras to train a neural network for classifying handwriting data (from MNST database) |
| Neural-Networks-Practice.ipynb | (1) Practicing with McCulloch-Pitts neural networks. Using matrices (NumPy, Pandas) to represent binary classification and plotting decision boundaries with matplotlib and seaborn, and (2) Building multi-layer perceptrons using tensorflow and keras. Normalizing visual data, configuring neural network, and plotting to visualize accuracy and loss. |
| PCA.ipynb | Using data on motor cortex neurons during movement from Nicho Hatsopolous's lab at UChicago. Interpreting data in context based on number of neurons and trials, visualizing neuron firing rates using matplotlib and seaborn, performing PCA using sk-learn to make data more easily interpretable. |
| Reinforcement-Learning.ipynb | Modeling learning in Rescorla-Wagner model (acquisition, extinction, blocking) |
| mini-lab-decoding.ipynb | Training classifier using leave-one-group-out cross validation in sk-learn based on data from Haxby (brain activity vs. visual stimuli). Visualizing accuracy with confusion matrix. |
